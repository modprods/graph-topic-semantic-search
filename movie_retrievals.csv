Three composers who fled war and National Socialism to the USA created the sound that still shapes film music today: Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner and Franz Waxman. In the early 20th century, these classically trained composers transformed the methods acquired in Vienna and Berlin into a new American art form: film music. They balanced the relationship between image and sound and developed techniques and dramaturgical tricks to achieve the greatest possible effect on the viewer.

Three composers who fled war and National Socialism to the USA created the sound that still shapes film music today: Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner and Franz Waxman. In the early 20th century, these classically trained composers transformed the methods acquired in Vienna and Berlin into a new American art form: film music. They balanced the relationship between image and sound and developed techniques and dramaturgical tricks to achieve the greatest possible effect on the viewer. Their influence is visible in the work of contemporary US composers such as John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith. Today, Oscar winner Hans Zimmer, Ramin Djawadi and Harold Faltermeyer continue this tradition. Their melodies are part of humanity's collective memory and reflect the combined traditions of European and American musical history.

Three composers who fled war and National Socialism to the USA created the sound that still shapes film music today: Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner and Franz Waxman. In the early 20th century, these classically trained composers transformed the methods acquired in Vienna and Berlin into a new American art form: film music. They balanced the relationship between image and sound and developed techniques and dramaturgical tricks to achieve the greatest possible effect on the viewer. Their influence is visible in the work of contemporary US composers such as John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith. Today, Oscar winner Hans Zimmer, Ramin Djawadi and Harold Faltermeyer continue this tradition.

The project uses found footage as a method for emphasizing the cinematic collisions between audio and visual composition. Working within the margins of structural filmmaking, Trouble with Johnny creates a visceral experience of fragmented sounds and cyclical imagery.  Likewise, Trouble with Johnny functions as a parody of the mainstream movie industry. The source material derives from the 1980’s coming of age film, The Karate Kid. Throughout the story, the main antagonist, a bully who goes by the name “Johnny”, is revered by a dedicated clique of subservient underlings. Applied as an experimental technique, the repetitive use of the word “Johnny” draws attention to the stereotypical and recurring tropes found in many teen movies.","{'title': 'Trouble with Johnny', 'overview': 'Trouble with Johnny explores the recurrence of loop, tempo, and flicker.
